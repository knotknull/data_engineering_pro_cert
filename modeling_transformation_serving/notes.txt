# Introduction to Data Modeling for Analytics

Overview

Data Modeling: A data model organizes and standardizes data in a precise structured representation 
              to enable and guide human and machine behavior, inform decision-making and facilitate actions 




Define the structure, relastionshiops and meaning of data.

Structure the data in a way that connects back to the organization
    - Data is understandable and valuable


Good Data Models 
    - Reflect the business goals and logic while incorporating business rules
    - Ensure compliance with operational standards and legal requirements
    - Outline the relationships between business processes
    - Serve as a powerful communication too, creating a "shared language"

ex. what is "an active users"



Poor Data Models 
    - Don't reflect how the busienss operates
    - Create more problems than they solve
    - Provide stakeholders with innaccurate information 
        and create confusion 


Targeted Data Modeling Approach
- Focus on specific business domains 

    Marketing:  Better understand customer behavior and campaign effectiveness
    Finance  :  Analyze spending patterns and identify cost-saving opportunities
    Machine Learning  :  Drive better decision-making and impactful AI models

# Conceptual, Logical and Physical Data Modeling


Conceptual:
    - describes business entities, relationships and attributes
    - business logic and rules
        - Entity - Relationshiop Diagram (ER)  (1 to 1, 1 to Many)

Logical 
    - details about the implementation of the conceptual model
        - column types, primary / foreign keys

Physical 
    - Details about the implementation of the logical model in a specific DBMS
    - Configuration details 
        - Data storage approach
        - Partitioning details
        - Replication details
