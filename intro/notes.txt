# Data Engineering Defined

    - originally seen as byproduct or "exhaust"
    - data has business value
    - data engineering work:

        [ ingestion ] [ transformation ] [ serving ]
        --------------------------------------------
                      [ data storage ] 

Data engineering is the development, implementation, and maintenance of systems and processes
that take in raw data and produce high quality consistent information that supports downstream 
use cases such as analysis and machine learning.

Data engineering is the intersection of:
         security, data management, DataOps,
        data architecture, orchestration, and software engineering

Data Pipeline: combination of architecture, systems, and processes that move data through the 
               stages of the data engineering lifecycle

in short: get raw data, turn in into something useful and then deliver



  Downstream                                      Data                        Upstream

Look for business value!!
    - don't get hung up on the technology
    - focus on the value that the tech can provide !!!!


# System Requirements
    - Business Requirements
            - revenue growth
            - increase user base
    - Stakeholder Requirements
            - needs of individual in orgranization
    - System Requirements
            - Functional Requirements
                - "The What"
                    - Updates to a DB
                    - Alert a user about data anomaly
            - Non-Functional Requirements
                - "The How"
                    - Tech specs of ingestion or orchestration 
                    - How you'l meed end user's needs

Jordan Morrow: Founder of Data Literacy 
    - ability to read, work with and analyze data

    - Understand audience
    - Understand business goals of company
    - Understand goals of stakeholders

Work on People Skills
Know how business operates

# Reguirements Gathering Conversation 

- what do they need
- how do they will use it
- when do they need it
    - is there value in real time ?
- format and time scope

# Stakeholder Needs into Specific Requirements

# Key Elements:
    - Learn what existing data systems or solutions are in place
    - Learn what pain points or problems there are with the existing solutions
    - Learn what actions stakeholders plan to take with the data
        NOTE: Repeat what you learned back to your stakeholders
    - Identify any other stakeholders you'll need to talk to if you're still missing information

Think like a Data Engineer:

1. Identify business goals &  stakeholder needs
    A. Identify business goals and stakeholders you will serve 
    B. Explore existing systems and stakeholder needs
    C. Ask stakeholders what actions they will take with the data product

2. Define System Requirements
    A. Translate stakeholder needs to Functional Requirements
    B. Define non-functional requirements
    C. Document and confirm requirements with stakeholders

3. Choose tools & technologies
    A. Itentify tools & tech to meet non-functional requirements
    B. Perform cost / benefity analysis and choose between comparable tools & tech
    C. Prototype and test your system, alaign with stakeholder needs

4. Build, evaluate, iterate & evolve
    A. Build & deploy production data system
    B. Monitor, evaluate and iterate on you system to improve it
    C. Evolve your system basedon stakeholder needs

# Intro to AWS Cloud

- compute
    - EC2
    - Container hosting services (EKS)
    - Serverless functions
- storage
    - Simple Storage Service (S3)
    - Elastic Block Store
    - Database Services
- networking
    - Virtual Private Clouse

# AWS Regions and Availability Zones

AWS Regions: collections of data centers within geographical areas where you can use AWS Services 
    - high reliability, availability, resilience
    - named for geographical name and region code: us-east-1 
            Region: us-east-1     AZ: us-east-1a, 1b, 1c 
            Region: eu-central-1  AZ: eu-central-1a, eu-central-1b
    - Each region contains at least 3 isolated and physically separated AZs  **


Availability Zones: Each Region comprised of multiple AZs 
    - multiple data centers make up Availability Zone
    - multiple AZs make up an AWS Region
    - physically separated by a meaningul distance from any other AZ 
        - all within 100km of eachother **

34 AWS Regions  **
108 Availability Zones  **

NOTE: Costs may differ between regions
      Certain regulations may rquire hosting your data in specific geographical regions
      Service availability no available in all regions

# Intro to AWS Core Services

Compute: 
    - Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) 
        - VM  / EC2 instance
    - Lambda
    - Elastic Container Service (ECS)
    - Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)


Network: 
    - Virtual Private Network (VPC): Private network you can crate and place resources into 
        - isolated from other networks
        - choose size of private IP space
        - subnets: partition into smaller networks
    NOTE: VPC spans AZs within a region
            - cannot span across regions
            - create a VPC in every region to operate in
        
        - data and resources don't leave region unless you build solution to do so

      Region
