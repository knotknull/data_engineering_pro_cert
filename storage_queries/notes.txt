Organizes data in the raw components and allows 
you to interact with stored data


OLTP: Online Transactional Processing Systems
  Focus on performing read / write queries with low latency


OLAP: Online Analytical Processing Systems
  Focus on applying analytical activities on data
  (aggregation, summarization)


Trade-off between storage costs and performance


# Storage Raw Ingredients - Physical Components of Data Storage

Raw Storage Ingredients

Magnetic Disks / HDDs / Magnetic platters with disk heads
    track / sector give address
    write: encode binary data by change magnetic field
    read:  converts magnetic field into binary data


Solid State Drives / SSD / Flash memory
    electrical charges in flash memory cells
      - charged   cell = 1 bit
      - uncharged cell = 1 bit
    read / writes faster than HDD

Improving Performance
Distributed Storage 
    - distribute daa across many HDD
    - read simulatneously 
    - transfer speed limiited by network


Partitioning 
    - slice SSDs into partitions
    - multiple storage controllers running in parallel




Latency (data access time)= Seek time + Rotational latency
Commercial magnetic disk drive: 7200 RPM (rev / min)


# Storage Raw Ingredients - Processes Required for Data Storage

Enhance:
  - read and write performance
  - data durability
  - data availability

Serialization

                Serilize
[ In-memory ] -----------------> [Disk ]
[  Format   ]      Transform     [Format]
              <----------------
                 DeSerialization
Data structures
optimized for 
CPU Usage



Row-based Serialization
[first record][ second record][ third record]
[object 1 ] [ object  2] ....

Column-based Serialization
[ bytes represent 1st col ] [ bytes represent 2nd col ] [ bytes represent 3rd col ] 
[ bytes represent 1st key ] [ bytes represent 2nd key ] [ bytes represent 3rd key ] 





Serialization Formats

Human-readable Textual Formats
    - csv:  row-based format
            prone to error, no defined schema
            adding new rows or columns requires manual handling

    - xml   viewed as legacy format
            slow to serialize / deserialize

    - json  used for plain-text object serialiazation
            viewed as new standard for data echanage of APIs

Binaryi Formats

    - parquet  Column-based format
               for efficient storage and big data proces

    - avro     row-based format
               Uses a schema to define its data structre 
               Supports schema evolution



Compression: a way to reduce the number of bits needed to reqpresent the data
    - remove redundancy and repetition of data to achieve 
       more efficeint encoding 

    - encode characters based on their frequency
    - requces disk space
    - improves query performance
    - Reduces the I/O time needed to load data


Compression Algorithms: 

lossless compression: decompressing file returns exact copy
lossy compression   : decompressions recovers something that sounds/looks like original. 
                      Not an exact copy.  (i.e. audio / video files) 


New compression algos prioritize speed and CPU efficiency over compression ratio:
    - Snappy
    - Zstandard
    - LZFSE
    - LZ4

General purpose compression to compress row and column stores:
    -LZO, LZ4, Snappy, Brotli, Oracle OZIP, Zstd
    

Some algos are specific to column stores: consecutive values from same column are stored together on disk. 
Compression improves database performance:
    - database processes queries faster 
        - less data to read from disk to memory and memory to CPU

Column-based compresion algos:
Run-lengh Encodding: compresses a run of the same values in a column 
      - each run is replaced with a tuple that has 3 elements 
        (value, start position, runLength)
      - each element is represented with a fixed number of bits

eg.     
        34 34 34 63 32 32 32 67 67 67

With RLE, you'll get this result: 

        (34, 1, 3), (63, 4, 1,), (32, 5, 3), (67, 8, 3)

Bit-Vector Encoding (or bitmap encoding): each distinct value is associated with a sequence of bits 
          where the length of the sequence is the same as the number of records / rows in the column  
           a '1' in the i-th position means that the ditinct value appears in the i-th row

34 34 34 63 32 32 32 67 67 67

With this algorithm, this data would be represented by four sequences of ten bits (i.e. the number of rows):

    bit-string for value 34: 1110000000

    bit-string for value 63: 0001000000

    bit-string for value 32: 0000111000

    bit-string for value 67: 0000000111

Bit-vecotr encoding is the most useful when columns have a limited number of unique values 
( i.e. US Staes, store id, product id)

Parquet is column based
Avro    is row based


Parquet Benefits:
    columnar storage
    various compression schemes: dictionary, run-length encoding 
    predicate pushdown:  query engines can skip reading irrelevant data blocks
    schema evolution  :  file format enables flexibl changes to data schemas
                            add or modify columns without breaking compatibility
    compatability     :  accomodates big data file formats 

Parquet Use Cases:
    - Big Data analytics
    - Data Warehousing
    - ETL Pipelines
        - Parquet can be used as an intermediate storage format in ETL pipelines
            can transform and process more efficiently before loading into data warehouse
    - Log Analytics: Parquet is well-suited for analysing log files and event data
            faster log analysis
    - Data Archiving: Good choice for long-term data archiving.



Avro Benefits:
    binary row-oriented format
    efficient serialize / deserialize
    Suitable for data interchange
    Schema-based Serialization
        - schema defines data structure 
        - schema and serialized data are stored in Avro data file
    Schema Evolution
        forward / backwared compatability
    Dynamic Typing 
        data can be searialized and deserialized without generating / sharing specific code

        data format supports several programming languages

Avro Use Cases:
    Data Interchange   : between apps, services, languages
    Streaming Analytics: used in streaming data pipelines
        efficient Serialization and compatability with streaming platform   
    Messaging Systems  :  message queues, etc.
    Data Replication   :  replicate data from one system to another
    Big Data Processing:  used with big data frameworks, Kafka.  
        data ingested, processed and analyzed efficiently across different stages of data pipeline


Clod Storage Options: Block, Object and File Storage

File Storage: organizes files into a directory tree
    Each directory contains metadata about its files / folders:
        - Name
        - Owner
        - Last Modified
        - Permissions
        - pointer to the actual entity

    Cloud FIle Storage Service 
        - Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)
        - provides access to shared files over a network 
        - Networking, scaling and configuration handled by clour vendor

    File storage sits on top of Block Storage


File Storage: divides files into small, fixed-size blocks of data and stores on disk
    - each block has a unique identifier
    - efficiently retrieve and modify data in individual blocks
    - can distribute blocks across multiple storage disks
        - higher scalability
        - stronger data durability

    i.e. think direct db writes or VM storage


Block Storage Lookup Table 
    File Piece     Block Identifier
  1st Piece             1232  
  2nd Piece             1234
  3rd Piece             1236
  4th Piece             1238


when ask for a file, all blocks are gathered and merged together
    can update a specific block by identifer and don't have to write entire file


Block Storage Use Cases:
    - Ideal for freuent access and modification
    - Enables OLTP systems to perform small and frequent read and 
      write operations with low latency
    - Provides persistent storage for virtual machines

Default storage for EC2:
    Amazon Elastic Block Storage (EBS)
    1. SSD for latency-sensitive workloads
    2. Magnetic disks to store infrequently-accessed data

NOTE: Block storage caps out at around several TB because it is attached to compute


Object Storage decouples data storage layer from the compute layer
    - can scale to Petabytes



Object Storage
    - Stores immutable files as data objects in a flat structure
    - organized into top-level logical containers (S3 Bucker)
    - each object assigned unique identifier (key)

s3://oreilly-data-engineering-book/data-example.json
|                                | |               |
+--------------------------------+ +---------------+
                |                         |
           
(must be unique across AWS)

    - once data is writtent object becomes immutable
    - have to re-write the entire object if file is updated
    - can scale horizontally and support performant parallel operations
        - each node holds shards of objects


Object Storage Use Cases:

        Ideal for                                       Not Ideal for
- Storage layer of cloud                            - Not good for supporting transactional workloads 
  data warehouses and data lakes

- Storing data needed in OLAP systems 
        (read heavy analytics)

- Machine learning pipelines
    - raw text
    - images
    - Videos
    - Audio

# Distributed Storage Systems

How Distributed Storage System Works

    - distribute data across multiple servers called nodes
        connected by network

    - groups of nodes make up a cluster

    - each node contains storage mediums
        - HDD / SSD

    - each node has processing abilities 
        - data management
        - replication / access control
Total Capacity is capacity of all nodes


 [------] [------] [------]
 [......] [......] [......] 
 [------] [------] [------]
    |        |        |
    +--------+--------+
             |
        Nodes / Groups of Nodes = cluster

Can scale horizontally by adding additional nodes to cluster

Single Machine Storage Architecture 
    - can only scale vertical
    - can only upgrade storage capacity of a single server

Multiple Nodes / Clusters: 
    -  Higher fault tolerance and data durability
    -  High Availability
    -  Processing many reads and write 
        operations in parallel
    -  Fast data access 
        - serve request from nearest replica


Distributed Storage Architecture utilized by 
    - Object Storage
    - Cloud Data Warehouse
    - Hadoop HDFS
    - Spark


Methods for Distributing Data

Replication:   Same copy across many nodes 
                High availability and performance                


Partitioning:   splits big dataset into smaller subsets 
(sharding)          i.e. partitions / shards

Takes time for updates to complete:
    - wait for update to complete
    - access "sort of" recent data


Distributed Storage Considerations: CAP Therom

CAP Therom: Any distributed  system can only guarantee 2 of 3 properties
    - Consistency
    - Availability
    - Partition Tolerance

Strong Consistency : every read reflects the latest write operation

Availability       :  Every request will recieve a response

Partition Tolerance:  System continues to function when network experiences 
                       distruptions or failures isolate some nodes from otheres
                        s(split brain)


No Distributed System is immune from network failures or disruptions  
    Network Paritioning has to be tolerated


Hence, have to choose between Availability or Consistence if Partition Tolerance is mandatory
    i.e. only 2 of 3 guaranteed 


    ACID (RDBMS) vs. BASE

BASE:  Baseically Available:  consistent data is available most of the time
       Soft-state          :  uncertain if transaction is committed or uncommitted   
       Eventual Consistency:  at some point, reading data will return consistent values   


# Database Partitioning / Sharding Methods

Common Sharding Methods:

Range-based sharding:
    - method splits rows based on a range of values
i.e. split by the first letter of  customer name

Name            Shard Key
A to I              A
J to S              B
T to Z              C
 

NOTE: can lead to unbalanced shards


Hashed sharding:
    - method uses a mathematical fomula called a hash function to determine how to partition data.
        - get a hash of some data attributes and use that as shard key

Geo sharding:
    - method partitions data by geographic location
        store cutomer informatin in a node that is physically in that location

# Comparing Cloud Storage Options

Object Storage
File   Storage
Block  Storage
Memory

Lab:

Object storage contains immutable objects of various sizes and types. 
Unlike files on a local disk, objects cannot be modified in place.

Between other features of object storage systems you can find:

    Durability and Redundancy: Object storage systems typically employ data redundancy and 
      replication techniques to ensure data durability and availability. Objects are often 
      replicated across multiple storage nodes or data centers to protect against hardware failures, 
      data corruption, and other types of data loss.

    Access Methods: Objects are accessed using standardized application programming interfaces (APIs) 
      such as Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) API. These APIs provide a set of operations for storing, 
      retrieving, updating, and deleting objects, as well as managing object metadata and access control.

    Data Access Patterns: Object storage systems are well-suited for storing unstructured data and large 
      volumes of data, such as multimedia files, backups, archives, log files, and data lakes. They are 
      commonly used in cloud storage services, content delivery networks (CDNs), and big data analytics platforms.



Lab:

following is an example of the timed_lru_cache decorator from cache-pandas package 
It allows you to store in memory the resulting data from from a function.  Compare the 
time of the first read and then after it is stored in cache:


@timed_lru_cache(seconds=100, maxsize=None)
def read_csv_to_memory(path: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Read CSV function with a cache decorator."""
    return pd.read_csv(path)

start = timeit.default_timer()
df = read_csv_to_memory('data/employees.csv')
end = timeit.default_timer()
print(f'Elapsed time: {end - start} seconds')



# first run
Elapsed time: 2.7644586910000726 seconds

# second run
Elapsed time: 5.668999983754475e-05 seconds


# thrid run, after waiting the 100 seconds on the cache
Elapsed time: 2.157280639000419 seconds

Row storage is ideal for OLTP. 
    - Performs read and write operations with low latency


What if you wanted to do analytics on price: 

select sum(price) from my_table

1 million rows
30 columns  
100 bytes per entry == 3 GB  of data to transfer to RAM
Data Transfer speed: 200 MB /s
Total transfer time: 3000 MB / 200 MB/s = 15 sec

if 1 billion rows == 3000 GB 

Total transfer time: 3000000 MB / 200 MB/s =  > 4 hrs

Column storage is ideal for OLAP. 
BUT, column storage is terrable for transaction workloads


# The Parquet Format 

Parquet and ORC (optimized row column) combine row and column approaches
    - paritioning rows into groups where each row group is stored in a column-wise format

  12558         45          12          87q
  45682         50          13          98q

Hybrid approach

 125893 | 456829 | 45 |  50  | 2 | 3 | 87q | 98q |  


Parquet file: data is horizontally partitioned into row groups, each row group has 
              a default size of 125 MB.  A row group consists of a column chunk for  
              each column in the data set.  Each column chunk is divided into pages, 
              where each page contains the encoded values for that column chunk, 
              metadata like min, max and count of values, along with other data 
              (repetition and definition levels) used to reconsturct the nested 
              structure of the data. 

NOTE: Parquet can be used to store tabular dta as well as nested data (i.e. JSON)
      An ADVANTAGE is that Parquet is portable and can interoperate with external tools easily.

# Wide-Column Databases

Key / Value
[ Key ] --> [ Value ]

Wide Column structures the value part of a key-value pair into more key-value pairs
    - Like two-dimensional key-value maps

                    |                                                   |
[ Row Key 1] --->>  | [ Column Key 1]  [ Column Key 2]  [ Column Key 3] |
                    |       |                 |               |         |

                    +---------------------------------------------------+


Each row describes a single entity that is identified by its row key.
Within a row, data that's related is modeled into column families that 
contain column names.  Actual data is stored in cells which are uniquely 
identified by the combination of the row key, column family and column name.



                    +---------------------------------------------------+ +------------------------------------+
                    |     [ Column Family: Customer Information ]       | | [ Column Family: Purchase Info ]   | 
[ Row Key 1] --->>  | [ Column Key 1]  [ Column Key 2]  [ Column Key 3] | | [ Column Key 1]  [ Column Key 2]   | 
   12345            |       |                 |               |         | |       |                 |          | 
                    |       V                 V               V         | |       V                 V          | 
                    | [   Value 1   ]  [   Value 2   ]  [   Value 3   ] | | [   Value 1   ]  [   Value 2   ]   |   
                    |                                                   | |                                    | 
                    +---------------------------------------------------+ +------------------------------------+

hence customer_id 12345 points  to two column families: customer information ( with three columns) 
and purchase information (with two columns)

NOTE: each cell is versioned and uniquely identified by its version number, typically a timestamp.

Wide column database doesn't envorce strict table schema, adding columns becomes very flexible. 
Column is only written if there's data for it.

column families are usually stored separately on disk i.e. customer separate from purchase info.
Data in a column family is stored in a row-oriented fashion.

Graph Databases

    Store data with nodes and edges 
    Node: represents data items
            entities i.e. people, products, locations 

    Edge: represents connection / relatinoship between the data items




    [node] ---edge---> [node] ---edge---> [node]
                        /\
                      /    \
                    /       \
                [node]     [node] 


 

Use Cases 
    - recommending products 
    - modeling social networks
    - representing network and IT operations
    - simulating supply chains logis
    - tracing data lineage

Use Case: Fraud Detection 
    - can flag users using same credit cars from different ip addresses


Use Case: Knowledge Graph
    - connect diverse data from disparate sources
    - chatbot utilizes RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) against purchase history (user, product, shipment)
    - gets fresh data to LLM to improve chatbot answers

# Vector Databases

    efficiently query data based on "semantic simularities" 
        - i.e. similarity search

Vector data:  numerical values arranged in an array

Vecotr embeddings:  
    capture semantic meaning on an item, like a text document or image

    [ Original  ] ---> [  ML  ] ---> [  Vector  ] ---> [  Vector  ]
    [  Data     ]      [Model ]      [embedding ]      [ database ]

    - can convert an entire database of docs or text into embeddings 
    - Embeddings help you more efficiently find and retireve similar items

    ex. finding similar text
            - compute embeddings for the query item
            - database returns similar vectors (based on closeness)


Vectors that are similar to one antother SEMANTICALLY will be closer to one another 
  in high dimensional vector space the are represented in.

        i.e. if vectors are close than items are similar

Distance Metric
    Vector database uses a distance metric to find similar vectors
        - euclidean distance (straigh line distance between points)
        - cosine distance  (angle)
        - Manhattan distance along their axis

Similarity Search:  Popular Algorithm 
    Want to find the K most similar items to a given item

    K-nearest neighbors (KNN)
        - will do exhaustive search over all the vector embeddings of all items to 
          compute the distance between those items and the given one 

        - becomes inefficient when the data size increases
        - suffers from the curse of dimensionality

    Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN)
        - find a good guess for the nearest neighbors
        - more efficient than KNN
            - with less accurate result
        - Vector databases are built to support ANN algorithms

        - When storing vector embeddings/ Vector database applies ANN algorithm to represent data for search
        - When querying Vector datbase to do a similarity search based on an item 
                - the dabase uses specific ANN algorith to traverse data structure to 
                  return items that are approximately close


# ANN Algorithm:  Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW)

        - HNSW is a popular ANN algorithm that underpins many vector databases
            - hierarchical graph representation of embeddings   
            - each layer consists of a graph representation of data 
                - top layer contains more of the longest links
                - botom layer contains more of the shortest links
                - as you move up from lowers layers to highest layer, number of nodes decreases

        - for a query, start at bottom and go to top layer, 
            starts entry node at top layer and navigates through the graph of that layer 
                each time choosing the neighboring node that is closest to the entry point. 
                stops at node the doesn't have any neighboring nodes closer to the query point. 
                    algorithm shifts to the node in the next lower layer and starts search again.
                    repeat until bottom layer.
